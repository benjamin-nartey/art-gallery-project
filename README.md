## A group project by Amalitech.


*DESCRIPTION*
-A simple website with two pages, a home page and a location page, that are linked to each other with visible buttons on the viewport.
-The website only uses three technologies; HTML, CSS and SCSS.
-SCSS is compiled to CSS.
-It can simply be run by visiting https://benjamin-nartey.github.io/art-gallery-project

*INSTRUCTIONS*
- By default the root font-size of html document is set to `16px`.
- For responsiveness sake I have initialized the `font-size` of the html root element to `62.5%`.
- that means `1 rem unit` is equivalent to `10px`  ie `10px/16px = 0.625.` 
- so always make sure your html root element font size is set to 62.5% if you intend to use the same conversion as mine.
