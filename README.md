*INSTRUCTIONS*
- By default the root font-size of html document is set to `16px`.
- For responsiveness sake I have initialized the `font-size` of the html root element to `62.5%`.
- that means `1 rem unit` is equivalent to `10px`  ie `10px/16px = 0.625.` 
- so always make sure your html root element font size is set to 62.5% if you intend to use the same conversion as mine.
